# About this project

Hello, I'm [Nicholas Hoover Wilson](nickwilson.soc), a professor of sociology at [Stony Brook University](stonybrook.edu).  I'm a historical sociologist of empire and imperialism, but over time I've gotten increasingly interested in the philosophy, methodology, and sociology of knowledge and science.

The purpose of this site is to serve as a supplement to my teaching of a large undergraduate course, *Introduction to Sociology*.  I began teaching this course when I first came to Stony Brook, and have now taught it off and on for nearly a decade.

For almost the whole time I've taught the course, I have relied on a textbook, and plan to do so again in the Fall of 2022.  However, I have begun this website with the ambition of progressively moving to it, and the notes it represents, as a primary source of materials for my Introduction class.

The goal of this is twofold.  First, it will allow greater flexibility in how I present materials, and (since it is hosted on Github), provide a space for potential collaboration with other scholars and students.  Second, I am mindful of the fundamentally exploitative and expensive nature of even "non-profit" publishers, and the crisis that their business-model now stands in.  By (eventually) breaking away from them, I hope to reduce costs for students (and direct whatever revenues may come from this to producers themselves and institutions from which they directly benefit.)
