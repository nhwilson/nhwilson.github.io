<p>Hello, I&#x2019;m <a href="nickwilson.soc">Nicholas Hoover Wilson</a>, a professor of sociology at <a href="stonybrook.edu">Stony Brook University</a>. I&#x2019;m a historical sociologist of empire and imperialism, but over time I&#x2019;ve gotten increasingly interested in the philosophy, methodology, and sociology of knowledge and science.</p>

<p>The purpose of this site is to serve as a supplement to my teaching of a large undergraduate course, <em>Introduction to Sociology</em>. I began teaching this course when I first came to Stony Brook, and have now taught it off and on for nearly a decade.</p>

<p>For almost the whole time I&#x2019;ve taught the course, I have relied on a textbook<label for="norton"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
</label>
<input type="checkbox"
       id="norton"
       class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Norton's *Seagull Introduction to Sociology*.</span>, and plan to do so again in the Fall of 2022. However, I have begun this website with the ambition of progressively moving to it, and the notes it represents, as a primary source of materials for my Introduction class.</p>

<p>The goal of this is twofold. First, it will allow greater flexibility in how I present materials, and (since it is hosted on Github), provide a space for potential collaboration with other scholars and students. Second, I am mindful of the fundamentally exploitative and expensive nature of even &#x201C;non-profit&#x201D; publishers, and the crisis that their business-model now stands in. By (eventually) breaking away from them, I hope to reduce costs for students (and direct whatever revenues may come from this to producers themselves and institutions from which they directly benefit.)</p>
